            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                This project involved recreating the cover of <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</em> by C.S. Lewis, focusing on the story’s central theme of the battle between good and evil. 
                The design highlights Aslan, the lion, who symbolizes courage and warmth, using fiery orange tones to reflect his noble and protective nature. Opposing him is the White Witch, embodying coldness 
                and malice with icy blue hues, emphasizing her association with winter and darkness. These two characters were chosen as focal points to represent the conflict at the heart of the narrative.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                Key elements from the story were incorporated to enhance the design. The lamppost, an iconic symbol marking the boundary between the real world and Narnia, was placed in the center, dividing the 
                lion and the witch to visually represent the contrast between good and evil. The background features a wardrobe, a critical element of the story, symbolizing the entryway to the magical world. 
                Surrounding the main elements with the wardrobe gives the design a sense of depth, as though the scene is unfolding just beyond its open doors.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The creation process involved editing and compositing in Photopea and Inkscape. I sourced individual images for the lion, witch, lamppost, and wardrobe, then combined them into a cohesive design using 
                tools like auto-blend, blur, and smudge. Shadows and a vignette effect were added to create depth, drawing the viewer’s attention to the central characters. I sharpened specific areas, such as Aslan’s mane 
                and the Witch’s clothing, to make them stand out.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                For the typography, I used a medieval-style font, "Celandine," to evoke a sense of fantasy and adventure. The title was placed at the top, while the author’s name was positioned at the bottom for balance, 
                resulting in a cover that captures the essence of the book.

The combination of simple shapes, minimalist font, and warm colors gives it a clean and modern look, while still retaining the playful and friendly spirit that fits a pet-themed cafe.

            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                For this project, I designed a logo for a fictional pet-themed cafe named "Pup Cup." The goal was to create a design that felt playful and inviting, reflecting the cafe's warm and cozy atmosphere 
                while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The central element of the logo is a puppy's face, designed to appear friendly and youthful, aligning with the cafe’s fun and lighthearted vibe. To make the logo unique, the cup referenced in the cafe’s name 
                was cleverly integrated into the puppy’s smile, positioned below its nose. This seamless blend creates a visual connection between the cafe’s theme and its name, adding a subtle but witty touch. Drooping ears were 
                used to give the puppy a softer and more approachable appearance.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The design process began with a rough sketch on a whiteboard to map out the key elements. I then brought the concept into Inkscape, using the Bezier curve tool to carefully trace and refine the puppy’s face and cup. 
                The saucer beneath the cup was created using the ellipse tool, with unnecessary portions erased to maintain a clean and polished look.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                Color choices were made deliberately to evoke the essence of a cafe. A warm brown was used for the logo’s main elements, representing coffee beans, while a soft beige background symbolizes cream, adding a comforting 
                and inviting feel. For typography, I selected the "Josefin Sans" font, known for its clean, modern appearance with a playful touch. The font’s minimalist design ensured that the text complemented the graphic without 
                overwhelming it.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The final composition places the design within a circular frame, tying the elements together cohesively. The result is a logo that’s simple yet effective, embodying the spirit of a pet-friendly cafe with warmth, charm, 
                and creativity.
