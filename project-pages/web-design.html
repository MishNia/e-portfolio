                This project involved creating a Harry Potter-themed pop quiz hosted on GitHub Pages. Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite book and movie series, making it an ideal theme for this fun and engaging quiz.

              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Web Hosting on GitHub Pages:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                To make the quiz easily accessible, I hosted it on GitHub Pages, a platform that allows seamless publication of HTML files directly from a GitHub repository. It is free, supports version control, 
                and is easy to share. The website URL, "MishNia," is derived from my GitHub username, which itself is an anagram of my name, "Hamsini."
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Design Enhancements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                I made several improvements to the quiz’s design to enhance its visual appeal and user experience.  
              </p>
              <ul class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                <li><strong>Fonts:</strong> I integrated custom fonts from Google Fonts to match the magical theme. The title uses the ‘Harry P’ font to evoke the iconic Harry Potter branding, while the body text uses ‘Cormorant Infant’ for readability and elegance.</li>
                <li><strong>Background and Colors:</strong> A background image of Hogwarts and Ron’s flying car was added to set the mood and context. A dark background with light-colored text improves readability and aligns with the magical theme.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout Adjustments:</strong> I centered all quiz elements using a container and added consistent padding and border radius for a more polished look. The table styling was updated with clearer boundaries and hover effects to improve interactivity. The heading font color was set to yellow, with a large font size (70px) to make it stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Flow Adjustments:</strong> I rearranged the “your response” and “result” sections, ensuring a natural sequence: users first select their response, then see the result. The selection box size was reduced for better alignment.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">JavaScript Improvements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The functionality of the quiz was enhanced with subtle JavaScript updates. The textarea for questions was made read-only to preserve the quiz’s integrity. Solutions are now displayed dynamically 
                in a styled <code>div</code> instead of a text input, offering better presentation and user experience. These updates ensure the quiz is visually engaging, accessible, and user-friendly.
              </p>

            <h2 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Taylor Swift Drag n Drop Quiz</h2>
            <a href="https://mishnia.github.io/drag-drop-ts/" style="color: #b2b2b2;" class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">https://mishnia.github.io/drag-drop-ts/</a>
    
            <img src="../image-resources/drag-n-drop-ts.png" style="width: 800px; padding: 20px;" class="hidden center animate-backInUp">
    
            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                This project features a Taylor Swift-themed drag-and-drop quiz where users match songs to their respective albums. As a Taylor Swift fan, I aimed to create an engaging, fan-centric experience that blends interactivity with a graceful aesthetic.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">HTML Modifications:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The quiz structure was modified to reflect its Taylor Swift theme. I updated the topic, headings, and content to focus on Taylor Swift albums and songs. Generic placeholders like "Learning Theories" and "Concepts/Names" were replaced with specific albums and song titles, making the quiz feel authentic and relevant to fans.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">CSS Styling Enhancements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                To align the design with Taylor Swift’s signature elegance, I adopted a muted and vintage-inspired aesthetic:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Background and Fonts:</strong> The background was set to a soft pink hue (#fdf1f0), evoking a warm and inviting feel. A classic serif font (Georgia) was selected to add a timeless, refined touch.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> A subtle rose accent (#d5a6bd) was introduced, combined with light, muted shades for the album boxes. These choices created a cohesive, elegant look consistent with Taylor Swift’s style.</li>
                <li><strong>UI Elements:</strong> Rounded corners and soft shadows were added to make the interface feel clean and airy. Hover effects were updated for a minimalistic experience, avoiding jarring contrasts and emphasizing smooth transitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Interactions:</strong> Each draggable element was styled with a polished finish to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Hosting on GitHub Pages:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                Similar to my previous projects, I hosted this quiz on GitHub Pages. This platform is both free and easy to use, making it ideal for maintaining and sharing interactive projects like this.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Result:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                These adjustments created a visually cohesive, graceful, and interactive quiz that immerses users in a fan-centric Taylor Swift experience. The design, paired with thoughtful interactivity, celebrates her music in a way that resonates with fans and offers an engaging way to explore her albums.
