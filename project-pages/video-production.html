            In my educational video, Evolution of Art, I wanted to create an engaging and visually appealing journey through the history of art. To achieve this, I used a range of effects and transitions to add depth and movement. I incorporated Ken Burns effects to highlight key details of each artwork by smoothly zooming and panning across them. For transitions, I chose cross dissolve, cross zoom, cross blur, and fade to black to create seamless changes between different art periods, giving the video a cohesive flow.

            To evoke the feeling of each era, I applied specific image effects. For the Renaissance paintings, I used a vignette and age film effect to give them an authentic, historical feel. For the newer art movements, such as Pop Art, I applied pop filters to emphasize their bold and contemporary nature.

        <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
            I recorded a voiceover that runs throughout the entire video, narrating the evolution and impact of each era. To enhance this, I added background music—Bach’s Air on the G String—which provides a smooth and timeless backdrop. I used the ducking effect to lower the volume of the music so that my voice stands out clearly, ensuring the narration is always easy to follow.

        <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
            I also included text overlays with a reveal transition to introduce each new era, making the timeline of art history easy to follow. This combination of effects, transitions, and carefully chosen audio was designed to create an immersive and polished viewing experience

            Creating this video was a way for me to share my passion for art and its fascinating evolution. I wanted to celebrate the beauty and impact of each era while making it engaging for the viewers.
